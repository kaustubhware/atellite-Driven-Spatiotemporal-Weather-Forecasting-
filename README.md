# atellite-Driven-Spatiotemporal-Weather-Forecasting-
basic detail of the project :
Developed an interactive system for region-specific weather prediction using GEE, Python, and JavaScript.

Incorporated time-series analysis, NDVI monitoring, and geospatial visualization for better insights into climate trends.

Enabled users to input shapefiles, specify locations (like Nashik, Pune, and Aurangabad), and analyze temperature, rainfall, and vegetation patterns.

Integrated machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering to forecast climatic conditions.

Focused on accessibility, real-time data analysis, and exportable outputs for practical decision-making.

ðŸŒ± Why It Matters:
With increasing climate uncertainty, accurate, location-specific forecasts are vital for agriculture, disaster preparedness, and urban planning. This project provides a scalable, open-source alternative that bridges the gap in traditional systems
